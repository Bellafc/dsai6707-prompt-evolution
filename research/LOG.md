# Research log (append-only)

### 2026-10-31 — environment created
- change: harness `src/mosaic`, prereg exp01, program.md, RunPod setup.
- state: offline tests pass (fake backend). No real model run yet.
- next: Task 0 on the pod.

## For the human
- Restore the original Confirmation prompts into `configs/prompts/` (remove the `<<PLACEHOLDER` line) and the
  original keyword lists into `configs/lexicons.toml` (remove `PROVISIONAL`).
- Put the Confirmation's saved generations (if they exist) in `data/legacy/{base,sft}_{school}.jsonl` for the
  parity check.
